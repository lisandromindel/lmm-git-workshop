### GitFlow
> Gitflow Workflow is a Git workflow design that was first published and made popular by Vincent Driessen at nvie.  
> Defines a strict branching model designed around the project release.  
> Is ideally suited for projects that have a scheduled release cycle.

Credits and great documentaiton with more detail explanations from Atlasian's approach: [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)  

#### Getting started  
We can install the git flow workflow to run native commands on the terminal  
`brew install git-flow`

And start up a project by running  
`git flow init`  
> Git-flow is a wrapper around Git. The git flow init command is an extension of the default git init command and doesn't change anything in your repository other than creating branches for you.
