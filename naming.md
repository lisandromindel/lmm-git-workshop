# 2. Naming
  
### Repository names  

`client-brand-productname` _in smallcase_

This gives clarity about the main client and groups projects more nicely on lists, as well as making it easy to search in the future.  

Example names would look something like this  
`supercell-make-website`  
`supercell-hayday-popmicrosite`  
`ea-nfs-heatstudio`  
`ef-funform-frontend`  
`nk-website` _(for cases where no brand is needed)_  

Any suggestions? Let’s discuss!  

___

### Branch names  

`feature/name`  
`hotfix/name`  
`release/version`  
`misc/test`  _(could be anything)_

### Origin

`master` _(for tagging)_  
`develop`  
`feature/name` _(can be used for pull requests)_

> Origin should be clean and only contain main branches
