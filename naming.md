# 2. Naming
  
### Repository names  

`client-brand-productname` _in smallcase_

This gives clarity about the main client and groups projects more nicely on lists, as well as making it easy to search in the future.  

Any suggestions? Let’s discuss!  

### Branch names  

`feature/name`  
`hotfix/name`  
`release/version`  
`misc/test`  _could be anything_

### Origin

`master` _for tagging_  
`develop`  

> Origin should be clean and only contain main branches
