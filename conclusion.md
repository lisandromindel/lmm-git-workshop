# Conclusion
  
Git is nothing else than a whole world on itself. There are countless approaches to it, and nothing is better than what the team feels confortable on.  

I strongly recommend doing a sitdown with your team and the lead developer to agree on what approach you will be taking, and get a buy-in from the team before getting started.
